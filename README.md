# WTHR.IN
#### Made with the use of RxSwift


## What's it?

### A simple APP for determining the weather forecast in cities around the world (More than 20,000 cities are available).

## What is implemented in the project?

### The response to a query (even an empty one) from the search bar is a list of all cities that match the search. Weather information for each city is displayed directly in the list and this happens dynamically, the app tracks your position in the list. These requests are cached. When you click on the cell of the desired city, you will be taken to the screen with detailed information and the date of the request. to update the data, simply open this screen again.
